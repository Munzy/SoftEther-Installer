## Currently tested on:

 - Ubunutu 16.04(x64)
 - Debian 8(x64)
 - Centos 7(x64)


## Currently does not work on:

  - Debian 9 -- Softether fails on make: https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/issues/301
  - Ubuntu 17.04 -- Same as Debian 9.
  
## Bugs
  
  Debian has a small bug where systemd doesn't like to initially use server vpnserver stop. To get around this I just used /etc/init.d/vpnserver stop once and from then on it worked. Any ideas?
  
  
## Original Script

  The original script was made by [Ahmad Shamli](https://github.com/AhmadShamli) and is located on [Github](https://github.com/AhmadShamli/SoftEther-Installer).
  
  He originally got the idea, and setup from [Digital Oceans Library](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-a-multi-protocol-vpn-server-using-softether). 
  
  I decided to redo it because of issues, and problems with installing it on my KVM vms. I also decided I could make it a little easier of a process with a few tricks.
